I have just released a first version of the `kantorovich` package on [Github](https://github.com/stla/kantorovich).
This package has two main features:

* It computes the extreme joinings of two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on a finite set;
* It computes the Kantorovich distance between these two measures, for a given distance on their finite state space.


With the help of the `rccd` and `gmp` packages, the `kantorovich` package can return the *exact* values of the extreme joinings and of the Kantorovich distance. 

## Quick example 

As an example, take $\mu$ and $\nu$ the uniform probability measures on a finite set having three elements.

```{r}
mu <- nu <- c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)
```

The `ejoinings` function returns the extreme joinings of $\mu$ and $\nu$. In this case these are the $6!$ permutation matrices:

```{r}
library(kantorovich)
ejoinings(mu, nu)
```

Since `mu` and `nu` were unnamed, the vector names `c(1,2,3)` has been automatically assigned to them. 
The Kantorovich distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$ is relative to a given distance on the state space of $\mu$ and $\nu$, represented by their vector names. By default, the `kantorovich` package takes the discrete $0\mathrm{-}1$ distance. Obviously the Kantorovich distance is $0$ on this example, because $\mu=\nu$. 

```{r}
kantorovich(mu, nu)
```

Note the message returned by both the `ejoinings` and the `kantorovich` functions. In order to get exact results, use rational numbers with the `gmp` package:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gmp)
mu <- nu <- as.bigq(c(1,1,1), c(3,3,3)) # shorter: as.bigq(c(1,1,1), 3) 
ejoinings(mu, nu)
```

## User-specified distance 

Let us try an example with a user-specified distance. 
Let's say that the state space of $\mu$ and $\nu$ is $\{a, b, c\}$, 
and then we use `c("a","b","c")` as the vector names.

```{r}
mu <- as.bigq(c(1,2,4), 7)
nu <- as.bigq(c(3,1,5), 9)
names(mu) <- names(nu) <- c("a", "b", "c")
```


### Define distance as a matrix 

The distance can be specified as a matrix. 

Assume the distance $\rho$ is given by $\rho(a,b)=1$, $\rho(a,c)=2$ and $\rho(b,c)=4$. 
The `bigq` matrices offered by the `gmp` package do not handle dimension names. 
But, in our example, the distance $\rho$ takes only integer values, 
 therefore one can use a numerical matrix:

```{r}
M <- matrix(
  c(
    c(0, 1, 2),
    c(1, 0, 4),
    c(2, 4, 0)
  ), 
  byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3,
  dimnames = list(c("a","b","c"), c("a","b","c")))
kantorovich(mu, nu, dist=M)
```

If the distance takes rational values, one can proceed as before with a character matrix:

```{r}
M <- matrix(
  c(
    c("0", "3/13", "2/13"),
    c("1/13", "0", "4/13"),
    c("2/13", "4/13", "0")
  ), 
  byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3,
  dimnames = list(c("a","b","c"), c("a","b","c")))
kantorovich(mu, nu, dist=M)
```

### Define distance as a function 

One can enter the distance as a function. In such an example, this does not sound convenient:

```{r}
rho <- function(x,y){
  if(x==y) {
    return(0)
  } else {
    if(x=="a" && y=="b") return(1)
    if(x=="a" && y=="c") return(2)
    if(x=="b" && y=="c") return(4)
    return(rho(y,x))
  } 
}
kantorovich(mu, nu, dist=rho)
```

Using a function could be more convenient in the case when the names are numbers:

```{r}
names(mu) <- names(nu) <- 1:3
```

But one has to be aware that there are in character mode:

```{r}
names(mu)
```

Thus, one can define a distance function as follows, for example with  $\rho(x,y)=\frac{x-y}{x+y}$:

```{r}
rho <- function(x,y){
  x <- as.numeric(x); y <- as.numeric(y)
  return(as.bigq(x-y, x+y))
}
kantorovich(mu, nu, dist=rho)
```


## A non-square example 

The `kantorovich` package also handles the case when `mu` and `nu` have different lengths, such as this example:

```{r}
mu <- as.bigq(c(1,2,4), 7)
nu <- as.bigq(c(3,1), 4)
names(mu) <- c("a", "b", "c") 
names(nu) <- c("b", "c")
```

Then it automatically assigns $0$ weights to the points that do not appear in the names of the shorter probability: 

```{r}
ejoinings(mu, nu)
kantorovich(mu, nu)
```
